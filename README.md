# Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates an implementation of logistic regression, a machine learning technique used for binary classification tasks. Logistic regression models the probability of a target variable belonging to a particular class by fitting a logistic curve, which makes it especially effective for tasks involving two distinct classes.

# Project Overview
Logistic regression is a statistical model that applies a logistic function to model a binary outcome, transforming feature values to probabilities that represent class membership. By calculating the log-odds of the probability, logistic regression finds an optimal decision boundary between the classes. This technique is ideal for tasks where the target variable has two possible outcomes, such as spam detection, disease diagnosis, or customer churn prediction.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to create and train a logistic regression model that accurately classifies data into binary categories. The model uses a sigmoid function to map predicted values to probabilities, effectively distinguishing between classes and enabling accurate binary classification.

# Today's Work
Implemented logistic regression using Python and relevant libraries. Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, standardize features, and balance class distribution. Trained the model, optimizing for high classification accuracy. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliable classification of the data.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
